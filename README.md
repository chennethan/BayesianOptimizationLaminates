A full-pipeline Bayesian optimization applied to composite laminate design for rocket structures. A physics-based solver (classical lamination theory + Tsai–Wu failure criteria) is combined with a machine learning surrogate model to efficiently search ply angles and thicknesses. Accelerates structural design workflows using uncertainty and predicted improvement, creates laminates with significantly lower failure indices and higher safety margins.
